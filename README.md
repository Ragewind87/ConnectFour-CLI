This is an incredibly simple brittle command line interface "Connect Four" game built using C# in about an hour.

It alternates back and forth between Player1 and Player2, accepting a single integer between 0-6.
Chips fall from the top in that column to the bottom.
The first player to "connect four" chips wins

I read that some developers got this problem during a technigal interview and I wanted to see how quickly I could do it.
